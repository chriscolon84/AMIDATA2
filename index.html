    <p>There is a big need for affordable housing in Community District 02 in Brooklyn, but the 185 new affordable housing units at 90 Sands, is not 100 percent affordable to members of the community.</p>
 
       <p> Residents began moving into 90 Sands as of mid-September.“This is one of the few hundred percent affordable projects in downtown Brooklyn and Dumbo overall,” said Patrick Bonck, vice president of communications at Breaking Ground, the developer of the building. </p>
        
        <p>The question is, who is this housing affordable to?</p>
         
       <p>The lottery for 185 of the units was open to low-income applicants, starting at $18,412, it went as high as $144,120, according to the NYC Housing Connect website.</p>
        
       <p>People who meet the criteria are eligible to apply for the lottery, which is then chosen at random.</p>
         
    <p>“There's no market rate in the building. There are certainly units for people who make 80%, and in this case,at 90 Sands, up to 120% of the area median income,” Bonck said.</p>
       
        
    

    <h3>90 Sands and AMI</h3>

    <p>The 2022 AMI for NYC was $120,100 for a three-person family, which is 100 percent of AMI. </p>
  
    <p>
        According to HPD, Housing Preservation and Development, people who make 80%-51% of AMI and below are considered low-income. Those who make 50%-30% of AMI are very low income and those who make 30% or less than AMI are considered extremely low-income. </p>

<p>Of the 185 available units being offered, the majority are for people who are making 100% of AMI and above. The units range from studios to one bedroom apartments. </p>
  
<p>The apartments available do not cater to those most in need, who are considered low-income or very low income, according to the metrics calculated by HUD. </p>

<p>John Dew, former chair of CB02 and longtime resident of Fort Greene said 80% (of AMI) does not reflect the bulk of New York City. “It certainly did not reflect the community that used to live in downtown Brooklyn before the up zoning of 2004,” he added. 
</p>
<p>Dew says that the use of AMI as a metric for affordable housing income determination is flawed. According to ANHD, the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development, the AMI benchmark is thousands of dollars greater than NYC’s actual household median income.
</p>



<p>In neighborhoods like Fort Greene and DUMBO, affordable housing is scarce. According to the Furman Center BK02 profile, of the 13,924 units built over the last decade, 21% were low income units.
</p>
<p>“The amount of affordable housing that is going to be in 90 Sands Street is sort of nominal as compared to the needs of the community,” Dew said. The need for affordable housing was cited by the Community Board as the number one issue the community is facing.
</p>
<p>Doreen Gallo, founder of the DUMBO neighborhood alliance and DUMBO resident, said all the other developments in Dumbo have no affordable housing. “[This is the] only affordable housing in Dumbo I worked on myself for 17 years” she said.

<p>Despite the affordability conundrum, residents support Breaking Ground’s mission to develop supportive housing for those exiting homelessness. The building will provide 305 units dedicated to this purpose.
</p>


<p>According to Bonk, there will be onsite social, medical, and psychiatric services provided by the Center for Urban Community Services.Tenant service coordinators will bring in educational and recreational activities and provide services such as yoga, art therapy and resume assistance.

</p>
<p>Applicants for supportive housing units will be directly referred by Breaking Ground’s street outreach and transitional housing programs. They will not have to apply for a housing lottery, which makes the process unique , according to Bonck. 
</p>
<p>Supportive housing residents will have a lease and will pay rent. However, the building ensures they will only pay up to 30% of their income.

<p>As of right now 76 people are living at 90 Sands, said Bonck. However, it is not known how many of the units are currently occupied by people who make 80% or less of AMI. 
</p>
<p>
    90 Sands is part of  NYC 1515 program, which is an affordable housing initiative that aims to provide 15,000 supporting housing units over the course of 15 years.
